# Visualizing-the-World-Through-its-Own-Worldview
Project 2 as part of the KTH course Data visualization. The task was to create a visualization using data from WVS and Gapminder, and use it to perform two discovery processes in which one interacts with the visualization to obtain information. A page containing the visualization as well as the discovery processes hosted through GitHub pages: https://wska.github.io/Visualizing-the-World-Through-its-Own-Worldview/
